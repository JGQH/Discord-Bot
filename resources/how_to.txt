Welcome to "BattleBot"! A simple bot that let's you battle against a bunch of other people.

Here are the game rules:
- Each time a round starts, the position of everyone in the board is revealed to you.
- Every round, you have the option to do a maximum of 3 actions:
    - move: Called using "!action move <dir>", were "dir" is either w, a, s, d. (No uppercase).
    - shoot: Called using "!action shoot". Your characters shoots using the rotation it currently has. If it impacts a player, that enemy loses 1hp.
    - aim: Called using "!action aim <deg>", were "deg" is the angle (In degrees) where your aiming to (Only integer values).
- The actions mentioned are in order of priority, meaning that among the first actions realized by every player, the "move" actions will be done firts, followed by "shoot" actions and finally "aim" actions.
- This behavior is repeated for every second and every third action in every round.
- Invalid actions are not considered, but valid actions that contain invalid values will be considered (For example, calling "!action move t" will result in no movement).
- Edges of the grid are connected, meaning that crossing the left edge takes you to the right edge. This behavior works with the top edge and bottom edge too (This does not affect the "bullets" shot using "shoot" actions).
- Your character is the brightest circle in the grid, the rest are the enemies.
- Each player has 3hp that represents your life points, and is visualized as the inner circle in every character. Once they get to 0, you're out of the game.
- Your angle of aim is represented by the arrow inside your character (You can only see your line of aim)

I hope it's all clear, and if it is, just say "!join" and wait for the game to begin!
